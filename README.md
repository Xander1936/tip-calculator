ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

// Get global access to all inputs / The divs here (you'll need them later ðŸ˜˜)
// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div

// numberOfPeople variable gets number of people from number of people div; captures the string from the user input 
// and turns it into a number with the JavaScript Number() method

// **The calculateBill() arrow function Calculates the total bill per person **

// **The increasePeople() arrow function incrases the number of the persons thats have to pay the bill. **

// **The decreasePeople() arrow function decrases the number of the persons thats have to pay the bill. **
